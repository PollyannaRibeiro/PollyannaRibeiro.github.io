				<h2>About</h2>

				<p>Curiosity, creativity and readiness to learn are important points that make me what I am, someone that is always ready to learn about new technologies, to make art from colours, vectors and images. I'm graduated in Brazilian Law and, living in London, I decided to go back to my first career option, design. Design was my first university course, studying for 2 years, learned about product, fashion, and history of design, craft, sustainability and ergonomics. I had worked in e-commerce and digital market for sometimes. Since last year, I have been deepening my knowledge in web design and in this year, I decided to focus and to study to become a Fron-End Web Developer.</p>

				<h2>Projects</h2>

				<p >Creating simple, responsive and intuitive websites is the focus of my studies. Being fast and understanding the needs of clients is important to create an option that is good for both clients and the final consumer. Blogs, single page sites, WordPress themes are some of the work that I have completed.

					<h3> Londres, cheguei! </h3>
					<p>This is a Brazilian website, it was developed to be a place where tourists can find information that can help them to have a good time visiting London e other cities in the Uk. I created the whole design, including the logo, colours, structure and responsivity. This is my first WordPress site, created in PHP, using my HTML, CSS, JS, JQuery, Materialize knowledge.

					<h3>Sandbox</h3>
					<p>This is a Brazilian website that was developed in 3 days, for a gaming fashion consulting startup to display at University event for potential angel investors. I created the whole design, including the logo, images in the background (parallax), v√≠deo, colours, structure and responsivity to use in landscape mode on iPads, laptops and monitors. The site was created with HTML, CSS, Materialize, JQuery and JS. To see the whole site, click <a href = "sites/sanbox-site/index.html">here</a>.

					<h3>Cyclopolis</h3>
					<p>When I was reaching where to buy my new bicycle, I found out that this neighbourhood store really needs a new website. I start working on creating a responsive website and on reorganizing their content, that was the most difficult. There was too much information on the front page, to avoid this,  collapse divs were used (Materialize), making it more flexible, simplifying it for the consumer to navigate the website. The website pictures are just samples and it's not finalized. For more details, click <a href = "sites/cyclopolis-site/index.html">here.</a></p>
